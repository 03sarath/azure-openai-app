      "With Azure OpenAI Service, users benefit from the security and enterprise-grade capabilities of Microsoft Azure combined with OpenAI's advanced AI models. The service enables integration into applications via REST APIs, Python SDK, or a web-based interface in Azure OpenAI Studio. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Features:\n",
      "- Models: Access to GPT-3, Codex, and Embeddings model series.\n",
      "- Fine-tuning: Available for several models, enabling task-specific optimization.\n",
      "- Security: Includes private networking, managed identity through Azure Active Directory, and responsible AI content filtering.\n",
      "- Regional Availability: Currently available in regions like East US, South Central US, and West Europe.\n",
      "- Use Cases: Can be applied for tasks like generative AI, summarization, code generation, semantic search, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Responsible AI:\n",
      "Microsoft emphasizes responsible deployment of AI models by requiring well-defined use cases, content filtering systems, and adhering to Microsoft's principles for responsible AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Users interested in accessing the service need to meet specific criteria and submit an application. After initial access, solutions must go through a use case review before being approved for production use. \n",
